Install Live Server Extension (Optional): You can install the "Live Server" extension in VSCode to easily launch a local development server and view your HTML file. To do this, go to the Extensions view (Ctrl+Shift+X), search for "Live Server" by Ritwick Dey, and click "Install".

Launch Live Server: After installing the Live Server extension, right-click on the index.html file in the explorer sidebar and choose "Open with Live Server". This will open your HTML file in a browser.
